# Automating Build Break Protection with GitHub Actions
Keeping your main branch green and deployable is critical. With a few lines of YAML in .github/workflows/ci.yml, you can:

Automatically run your backend and frontend builds whenever someone pushes or merges into main.

Block merging via branch protection if either build fails (youâ€™ll wire up the status checks in Settings).

Hereâ€™s what the workflow does, step by step.

```yml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Build Breaks

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  backend-build:
    name: ðŸ›  Backend Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18.x"
       

      - name: Install backend dependencies
        run: |
          cd backend
          npm ci

      - name: Build backend
        run: |
          cd backend
          npm run build
          

  frontend-build:
    name: ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18.x"
        

      - name: Install frontend dependencies (ignore peer-dep conflicts)
        run: |
          cd frontend
          npm ci --legacy-peer-deps

      - name: Build frontend
        run: |
          cd frontend
          npm run build
```

1. When this workflow runs
- `on.push.branches: [main]`
Every time code is pushed directly to `main`.

- `on.pull_request.branches: [main]`
Every time a PR is opened or updated targeting `main`.

Together with branch protection (in your repo settings), this means:

- No direct push or merge will complete until these build jobs pass.
- Any failure will block merges, keeping `main` healthy.

2. Two parallel jobs: backend-build & frontend-build

GitHub Actions splits your CI into two independent jobs, one for each part of your stack:

ðŸ›  Backend Build
1. `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
Spins up a fresh Ubuntu VM.

2. Checkout code

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
```
3. Install Node.js
```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: "18.x"
```
4. Install dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm ci
```
- `npm ci` is optimized for CI: it installs exactly whatâ€™s in `package-lock.json`.

5. Run your build
```bash
cd backend
npm run build
```
-Fails fast if any compile or bundling error occurs.

ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Build
1. `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`

2. Checkout code

3. Install Node.js

4. Install dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
```
- Uses `--legacy-peer-deps` to bypass any peer-dependency conflicts.
5. Run your build
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

3. Wiring it into branch protection
Once this workflow lives in your repo:

Go to Settings â†’ Branches â†’ Add branch ruleset.

- In the Ruleset Name* type a name for the ruleset.
- From the enforcement status dropdown select Active.
- From the Add target dropdown click Include by pattern type main and click Add Inclusion pattern button.
- Check Restrict deletions
- Check Require a pull request before merging
  - From the Required approvals select 1 or 2 as per your requirement. (I have selected 1).
- Check Require status checks to pass
  - Check Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Click on Add checks dropdown and write test name from the earlier workflow in the search bar and check it. In my case test names are backend-build & frontend-build.
- Click create and then click save


Now:

Direct pushes to main are blocked.

PRs can only be merged if both build steps succeed.

## Why this matters

Zero manual gating: Every push or PR automatically kicks off your build.

Immediate feedback: Broken builds are flagged in GitHubâ€™s UI before any human review.

Safer main: With branch protection, you prevent regressions from ever landing in your production-ready code.

Thatâ€™s itâ€”no servers to configure, no extra CI software. Just drop in this YAML, set up branch protection, and let GitHub Actions guard your main branch for you.
