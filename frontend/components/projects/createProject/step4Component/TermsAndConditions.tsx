        Credits purchased are tied to your account and can be used for any
          project you create. You can add credits at any time. Signature Service
          will be billed based on actual streaming time and will be charged in
          15-minute increments. Concierge Service is billed based on scheduled
          sessions. You may reschedule or modify a session up to three business
          days in advance without penalty. Cancellations, changes, or no-shows
          within three business days of any session will be charged the full
          time of the original scheduled session, along with any additional time
          required for rescheduling. Sessions will be charged in 15-minute
          increments. If you exceed your pre-paid credits—including time
          overages and/or scheduling changes—you will be billed at a rate of
          $175 per 100 credits, billed in 100 credit increments to replenish
          your account. These credits will be automatically charged to your
          credit card on file on the day the usage is incurred.
